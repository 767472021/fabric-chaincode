# Flogo extension for Hyperledger Fabric chaincode

This Flogo extension is designed to allow developers to design and implement Hyperledger Fabric chaincode in the Flogo visual programming environment. This extension supports the following release versions:

- [Flogo Web UI](http://www.flogo.io/)
- [Hyperledger Fabric 2.2](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric)

The [Transaction Trigger](trigger/transaction) starts chaincode transactions for requests containing preconfigured input parameters and/or transient data.

The Flogo extension supports the following activities for storing and querying data in the distributed ledger and/or in private data collections.

- [**Put**](activity/put): Insert or update data in the distributed ledger or a private data collection, and optionally update associated compsite keys.
- [**Put All**](activity/putall): Insert a list of records into the distributed ledger or a private data collection, and optionally update composite keys of each record.
- [**Get**](activity/get): Retrieve the current state corresponding to a state key in the distributed ledger or a private data collection.
- [**Get by Range**](activity/getrange): Retrieve all states in a specified range of state keys in the distributed ledger or a private data collection. It supports pagination for resultset from the distributed ledger.
- [**Get by Composite Key**](activity/getbycompositekey): Retrieve all states corresponding to a partial composite-key in the distributed ledger or a private data collection. It supports pagination for resultset from the distributed ledger.
- [**Get History**](activity/gethistory): Retrieve the history of states corresponding to a state key in the distributed ledger.
- [**Query**](activity/query): Retrieve all states by a Couchdb query statement for the distributed ledger or a private data collection. It supports pagination for resultset from the distributed ledger.
- [**Delete**](activity/delete): Mark the state as deleted for a state key in the distributed ledger or a private data collection, and deletes its associated composite keys. Optionally, it can delete only the state, or only a composite key.
- [**Set Event**](activity/setevent): Set a specified event and payload for a blockchain transaction.
- [**Set Endorsement Policy**](activity/endorsement): Set state-based endorsement policy by adding or deleting an endorsement organization, or by specifying a new endorsement policy.
- [**Invoke Chaincode**](activity/invokechaincode): Invoke a local chaincode, and returns response data from the called transaction.

With these Flogo extensions, Hyperledger Fabric chaincode can be designed and implemented by using the **Flogo Web UI** with zero code.

## Getting Started

- Download and setup Golang from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).
- Clone this repo into an empty working directory: `git clone https://github.com/open-dovetail/fabric-chaincode.git`
- Setup development environment by executing the script: `scripts/setup.sh`
- Build and run a sample Flogo model [marble](./samples/marble) as described in [README.md](./samples/marble/README.md)
